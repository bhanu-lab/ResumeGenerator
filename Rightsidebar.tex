\begin{itemize}
\item I have done this using Arduino Uno. This project is about how automatically a trash can opens the lid with the help of ultrasonic sensor , in presence of a person in front of it. LED tracker to indicate the capacity of the trash can, through IR sensor. On reaching the certain level the trash can notifies the collector with the help
of (HC-05)bluetooth module
\end{itemize}
